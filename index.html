<div id="headertext">What we do</div>

<div id="subtext">The Flocktracker Android-based smartphone application advances traditional data collecting methodology, enabling the creation of data sets quickly and easily. Our goal is to enable researchers and technocrats to create inexpensive, highly accurate, and robust data sets through traditional surveying methods that were previous unattainable or exceedingly labor intensive.

<div id="headertext">Organization overview</div>

<div id="subtext">Flocktracker is a tool developed as a robust and flexible research application for spatial research initiatives in both Dhaka, Bangladesh and Mexico City, Mexico. The project is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort under the research of MIT professor P. Christopher Zegras’ Mobility Futures Collaborative in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. The current application is based off of initial designs produced with Urban Launchpad in the mapping of Dhaka’s bus system to create the city’s first complete bus map.<a id="email" name="team"></a></div>
