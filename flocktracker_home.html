<div id="headertext">What we do</div>

<div id="subtext">The Flocktracker Android-based smartphone application advances traditional data collecting methodology, enabling the creation of data sets quickly and easily. Our goal is to enable researchers and technocrats to create inexpensive, highly accurate, and robust data sets through traditional surveying methods that were previous unattainable or exceedingly labor intensive.</div>

<div id="headertext">Who we are</div>

<div id="subtext" style=font-family:'robotolightitalic'>Kuan Butts</div>

<div id="subtext">Born and raised in San Diego, California, Kuan is currently a Masters student at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he is studying City Planning with a primary focus in Transportation. Kuan has a professional background in urban planning and architecture. Presently residing in Somerville, Massachusetts; Kuan has worked extensively throughout the Midwest and holds a special interest in tackling issues unique to the recuperation of Rust Belt urban economies and the retrofitting of existing travel infrastructure. Specifically, he seeks to adapt and leverage untapped potential in extant infrastructure to modern mode choice and travel behavior demands.</div>

<div id="subtext" style=font-family:'robotolightitalic'>Arturo Cadena</div>
<div id="subtext">Arturo is an urban planning student at UNAM who has worked with local government and research projects focusing on "Urban Social Production." He started on the Flacktracker effort in 2013 when he worked with MIT+UTL flocksourcing Mexico City busses. On that project, he surved as an urban speciality and geospatial analyst. Since this initial project, he has gone on to become a founding member of Urban Launchpad Mexico.</div>

<div id="subtext" style=font-family:'robotolightitalic'>Danny Chiao</div>
<div id="subtext">Danny Chiao is a recent graduate from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department of MIT. He now works at Google. Danny first began working with the Flocktracker project in early 2013, helping optimize the Dashboard set up for our team when preparing to work in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He now resides in New York City.</div>

<div id="subtext" style=font-family:'robotolightitalic'>Daniel Palencia</div>
<div id="subtext">Daniel is a civil engineer currently spending most of his time programming and riding his bike around Mexico City. He started on the Flacktracker effor in 2013 when he worked with MIT+UTL flocksourcing Mexico City busses. On that project, he served as the primary programmed for Mexico City specific coding modification that were performed on the existing specifications from previous research initiatives in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Since this initial project, he has gone on to become a founding member of Urban Launchpad Mexico.</div>

<div id="headertext">Organization overview</div>

<div id="subtext">Flocktracker is a tool developed as a robust and flexible research tool for ongoing studies in both Dhaka, Bangladesh and Mexico City, Mexico. The project is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort under the research of MIT professor P. Christopher Zegras’ Mobility Futures Collaborative in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. The current application is based off of initial designs produced with Urban Launchpad in the mapping of Dhaka’s bus system to create the city’s first complete bus map.</div>
