<div id="headertext">All about Flocktracker</div>

<div id="subtext">The Flocktracker Android-based smartphone application advances traditional data collecting methodology, enabling the creation of data sets quickly and easily. Our goal is to enable researchers and technocrats to create inexpensive, highly accurate, and robust data sets through traditional surveying methods that were previous unattainable or exceedingly labor intensive. To learn more, click here to visit our full about page. The below sections will elaborate further on the application, its potential, and our past.</div>

<div id="headertext">What sets Flocktracker apart?</div>

<div id="subtext">Flocktracker addresses the limitations of current, pen and paper survey methodology; enabling surveys to be deployed with greater ease. Furthermore, they are performed faster, more accurately, and in a user-friendly manner that generates robust, contextual data sets. Unlike other surveying apps, Flocktracker is capable of handling complex survey structures (tree structures with jumps between questions depending the answer of a question) and different kinds of questions, like multiple choice, check-box, open questions, “take a picture” questions and “order the list” questions. All this is customizable via a markup language created just for handling surveys, so the user is able to customize the project they wants to work in.  The resulting output enables far more insightful analyses than prior possible, incorporating any variables, such as vehicular crowding, deemed relevant, as well as spatial and temporal data, like time, position, elevation and speed.
<br>
<br>
We want to make this app a universal surveying and tracking app, suitable to be adapted to handle long and complex socio-demographic surveys, but also capable of being friendly to create small surveys for small on-site surveys. Flocktracker is not just for social scientists and transportation engineers but anyone interested in engaging their urban environment!

<div id="headertext">Increasing ubran awareness</div>

<div id="subtext">Flocktracker’s ease of deployability and rapid output analytics enables anyone from analysts and traffic engineers to interested citizens to easily and effectively operate surveys capable of generating substantial data, effectively and effortlessly, for urban analyses.

<div id="headertext">Tapping Flocktracker's potential</div>

<div id="subtext">In short, Flocktracker takes the “black box” of urban analytics and makes it highly accessible. Because data is geospatially and temporally validated, falsification of data is significantly harder to accomplish. While data quality is typically reliable in much of the developed world, having a simple, downloadable tool to vet data, particularly in the rapidly-developing world, allows for the quick production of quality data that can be used to validate or, more importantly, stand up to technocratic decisions based of obfuscated, closed data. 
<br>
<br>
In addition to the technical capabilities of the application, prior operations, particularly through the organization of involved university students in cities from Dhaka to Mexico City; watching the quick development of teams dedicated to engaging local communities and motivated people to work on the improvement of public services mainly transportation systems was in itself inspiring. In that sense, Flocktracker simply became a medium by which inspiring individuals were able to better volunteer themselves to accomplish equally inspiring results.

<div id="headertext">A brief history of the applicaton</div>

<div id="subtext">Flocktracker began at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning under Albert Ching and Stephen Kennedy as a strategy to spatially measure the location and crowding of riders on buses in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the intent of producing the first complete bus map of the city - a Kickstarter campaign that has since been successfully accomplished. More on this project, an effort that continues to this day, can be found online at urbanlaunchpad.org. This project then grew to multiple cities, from Mexico City to St. Louis, Missouri. Efforts have been targeted since been targeted towards improving the applications operability, as well as devising methods to make surveys downloadable and the application self-assemblable, given different projects.
